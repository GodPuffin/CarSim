## Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>
This car physics simulation project utilizes Java and JavaFX to create a dynamic simulation considering car weight, mass, friction coefficients, and more. It incorporates an interactive sidebar for user control, terrain selection, and graphical representation of key physics variables.

## Usage Guide <a name="usage-guide"></a>

### Controls <a name="controls"></a>
The controls for the simulation are straightforward:
- `Up Arrow`: Apply throttle
- `Down Arrow`: Apply brakes
- `Left Arrow`: Steer left
- `Right Arrow`: Steer right

### Features <a name="features"></a>
1. **Sidebar Interface**: 
    - Adjust engine power, car weight, and zoom intensity using sliders.
    - Select terrain among asphalt, gravel, and ice.

2. **Graphs Display**:
    - Visualization of acceleration, velocity, position, speed, and throttle changes over time.

3. **Main Canvas**:
    - Displays the live simulation of car physics considering the chosen parameters.

### Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
If you encounter issues:
1. **Simulation Not Starting**:
    - Ensure Java and JavaFX are properly installed and updated.
    - Check console for error messages that might indicate missing dependencies or code issues.
2. **Controls Not Responding**:
    - Verify keyboard inputs are not conflicting with other applications.
    - Check for any errors in the code related to input handling.
